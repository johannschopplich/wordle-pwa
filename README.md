# More Wordle

A forked, refactored and extended Vue app of [VVordle](https://github.com/yyx990803/vue-wordle) by Evan You, which itself is a implementation of the original [Wordle game](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).

This wordle project can be easily customized.

## Make Your Own Wordle

### Base64

You can make your own Wordle and send it to friends by base64-encoding a word and include it as the URL query, e.g. [`ostern.netlify.app/?anVsaWE=`](`https://ostern.netlify.app/?anVsaWE=`). This will also allow words that are not in the dictionary.

### Custom Word List Via `.env`

Alternatively, you can add a custom word list to pick from to your loccal `.env` file and set a start date as well:

```dotenv
VITE_ANSWERS=first,scond,third
VITE_STARTS_AT=2022-04-01
```

More Wordle will calculate the difference between the current date and the start date and pick the answer at the array index based from the date difference.
